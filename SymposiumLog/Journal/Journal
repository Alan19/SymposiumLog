Goal:I need to try polishing up the website by populating it with text that relates to the project.

Result:I added a list to Javiy's college selection list. 

Next session:I need to get other parts of Javiy's page converted into material design and polish the index page so it doesn't look like I copied it from somewhere else.

Goal:I need to look into storing information on a server with Anthony and Max.

Result:We discussed what the client will want and I committed Javiy's code because he has a fever and can't work.
